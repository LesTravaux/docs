# TheHive 
TheHive is a scalable, open source and free Security Incident Response Platform designed to make life easier for SOCs, CSIRTs, CERTs and any information security practitioner dealing with security incidents that need to be investigated and acted upon swiftly.

TheHive supports different methods to store data, files, and indexes according to your needs. However, even for a standalone, production server, we
 strongly recommend using Apache Cassandra as a scalable and fault-tolerant database. Files and indexes storage can vary, depending on your target setup ; for standalone server, the local filesystem is suitable, while sereval options are possible in the case of a cluster configuration. 


## Installation and configuration guides
[This documentation](./installation-and-configuration/index.md) contains step-by-step installation instructions for TheHive for different operating systems as well as corresponding binary archives. 

All aspects of the configuration are aslo detailled in a dedicated section.

## User guides
TheHive supports differents roles for users. Depending on if you are an administrator of the plateform, an administrator of an organisation or an analyst you can have access and run differents actions in the plateform. 

The [user guides](./user-guides/index.md) aims at describing all major howtos for users according to their roles and permissions.
